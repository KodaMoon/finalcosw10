                    Hi, my name is <strong>Gerard Gorlero</strong>, I have always been into tech, from hardware to software. I believe tech will keep growing at a quick 
                    pace and always have jobs available as computers and software are an essential part of human life at this point in time and will continue to be. I want 
                    to be a apart of this industry and to learn and grow with it. I am currently a student at <em>Long Beach City College</em> and I am apart of the Web 
                    Development Program and my goal to be a UI/UX designer in the future. 
                </p>

                    My journey started in April 2022, I had recently switched my major to Web Development and I signed up for summer courses for my new major for June of this year. 
                    I decided to go self-taught for a bit to get a grasp and get ahead before my courses started since it was suddent shift in majors, I felt I would get behind in
                    the class. I looked into so much into this career and found that there are so many free online resources to go through with web development that some poeple 
                    even succeed and get jobs by solely being self-taught. I chose The Odin Project as my free program to go through and I got through the HTMl and a tiny bit of
                    the CSS portion by the time my summer courses started. I didn't use TOP whilst in my courses as the work load was heavy but will continue when this semester is 
                    over before my Fall courses begin in a couple of weeks.

                    My <strong>end goal</strong> is to become a senior web developer or a UX/UI designer for a good tech company, it doesn't really have to be a <strong>FAANG</strong> company but that would be the 
                    peak of my goal. My <strong>mid-term goal</strong> is to get comfortable with HTML, CSS, JS and a framework like React and to land a entry-level job by next year when getting
                    my associates degree. Lastly, my current and <strong>short-term goals</strong> is to master and get really comfortable with CSS, and mesh that well with HTML. I have high 
                    hopes for the future as two months ago I knew next to nothing about CSS besides selectors, and after taking two courses over the summer, I have learned flexbox,
                    grid and other elements of CSS which I am still getting a grasp on but it is something I would never thought I would ever learn so quickly in a span of two months.
                    Now for the next months I am going to solidify my CSS knowledge so I can start implementing Java Script, which I am very eager for.
